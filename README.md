# Project 2 - Projektowanie i analiza algorytmÃ³w
This project was created as part of university coursework for the subject "Design and Analysis of Algorithms". It's a implementation of adjacency list and adjacency matrix graphs. It's purpose is to compare both implementations in Dijkstra algorithm.

## Installation
>[!WARNING]
>Project was originally built and tested on Windows.
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mikolaj-paz/Projekt-2-projektowanie-i-analiza-algorytmow.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd Projekt-2-projektowanie-i-analiza-algorytmow
```
3. Create a build directory and run CMake:
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

## Usage
Files can be used as a library to implement graph and Dijkstra algorithm.
>[!WARNING]
>This is only a basic implementation and doesn't guarantee reliability.
